[h2]Overview[/h2]

Do you find yourself spending a lot of time finding spouses for your courtiers, or deciding on characters to invite to your court, who could be better councillors, court position holders, knights, or commanders? While both [b]Find Spouse[/b] and [b]Invite to Court[/b] interactions are great since they enable the player to attract better talent than by recruiting guests, and furthermore do it for free, they suffer from a few major drawbacks:
[list]
  [*] They require a lot of micromanagement on the player's part since the options could be either too numerous or (in some cases) hard to find.
  [*] The AI never uses them, ending up with a much worse talent pool as a result. On the other hand, the player can get the best courtiers via marriages at their leisure, since they are usually not married and therefore always available.
[/list]

I personally find the above aspects to be tedious, unrealistic, and underwhelming. Why should it take so much effort to find good spouses for courtiers? Why would courtiers depend so much on their liege for getting married? And why should players enjoy such overwhelming advantages over the AI to attract valuable courtiers?

This mod attempts to address these drawbacks by enabling courtiers to actively search for spouses (and in the future also acquaintances to invite) by themselves and only ask their liege for approval, thereby reducing the effort for the player, improving the quality of AI talent pools and therefore the overall AI competitiveness, and also contributing to better roleplaying and immersion.

This mod introduces a new [b]Courtier Requests to Marry[/b] event for courtier marriages. It is triggered for playable (count or higher) rulers, every year for players and every 3 years for AI by default, if they are "available for events" (not traveling or involved in an activity). These event frequencies can be changed via game rules.

When the event fires, first a random eligible [i]courtier[/i] is selected who will search for a spouse for themselves. To be eligible, a courtier must satisfy a number of conditions, such as being an available adult, not already married or betrothed, younger than 60 years and not having a serious health condition, not an heir or close family to their liege (since these are already married by AI for alliances), and not "wrong gender in faith", e.g. a female in a faith with the male-dominated doctrine (the eligibility of such characters can be configured via a game rule).

After the courtier has been selected, a marriage [i]candidate[/i] is also selected among all eligible non-ruler characters in this and neighboring realms and located within a certain range of the original ruler's capital that can also be configured via game rules. The candidate selection proceeds in several stages:
[list]
  [*] First, all eligible candidates are determined. To be eligible, a candidate must satisfy many of the same conditions that apply when selecting a courtier, and in addition they must be someone whom the courtier can actually marry according to their gender and faith, and either someone to whose gender the courtier is attracted, or someone of the opposite gender if both characters are fertile.
  [*] Next, the [i]quality[/i] of the eligible candidates from the perspective of the courtier is evaluated, based on various criteria such as opinion, attraction, fertility, health, age and age difference, dynasty prestige difference, faith hostility, cultural acceptance, genetic traits, skills, and prowess.
  [*] Next, all candidates with quality above a certain threshold are checked if their [i]matchmaker[/i] (their liege for courtiers, or themselves otherwise) would accept the marriage proposal.
  [*] Finally, the highest quality candidate whose matchmaker would accept the marriage proposal is selected as the actual candidate.
[/list]

After a courtier and a candidate have been successfully selected, the event enables the courtier's liege to approve or reject the marriage. If the candidate is an outsider, the event description lists the reasons to accept them as a courtier. If they are better than any other available options for any councillor positions, court positions, knight, or commander, this is explicitly mentioned in the description.

Note that since the candidate has been selected based on their quality from the courtier's perspective, they are not automatically a good choice for their liege. However, often this is actually the case, since many of the criteria used to determine the quality (skills, genetic traits, age, fertility, etc.) would be relevant to the liege as well. So while courtiers would in most cases not make better choices than you as a player might make, they would usually make reasonable choices that are also of good roleplaying value.

When the event fires for AI rulers, they evaluate the candidate carefully before approving or rejecting. AI rulers are in general more eager to approve outsiders rather than characters who are already their courtiers, since marriages to outsiders are a great way to attract talent to their court. They also take the into account various other criteria, such as their opinion of both courtier and candidate, family and other relations, and the candidate quality. For outsiders, there are also additional considerations such as is the candidate a better choice than any other available options for any councillor positions, court positions, knight, or commander, and does the candidate have any useful claims.

To make it more convenient for players to trigger the event for particular courtiers, this mod adds the new [b]Ask to Find Spouse[/b] interaction. Only courtiers who are eligible according to the criteria mentioned above can be targeted by this interaction.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]

The current version is compatible with CK3 1.11 and is also savegame compatible.

This mod does not modify any vanilla files and should be compatible with most other mods. Note that some total conversion mods remove parts of vanilla that may be referred to by this mod, so compatibility with such mods is not guaranteed. If you use such mods, set the game rule [b]Marriage Acceptance by AI[/b] to [b]Original[/b] to let the changes to marriage acceptance by the conversion mod take effect.

This mod also supports changing its game rules mid-game with the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2826829936]Gamerule Gadget[/url] mod.

[h2]Localization[/h2]

This mod is currently available in English. For other languages, it uses the original English text as a placeholder.

[h2]Performance[/h2]

Since the additional events introduced by this mod fire on a regular basis for a few hundred AI rulers and involve sophisticated character searches, they may negatively affect the overall game performance. Therefore, this mod introduces game rules to let players find the best balance between a better AI and a smooth gameplay experience for their hardware and selection of other mods. With the default settings, this mod is about 10% slower than vanilla if measured on max speed in observed mode, a difference that is usually not noticeable during an actual gameplay.

As a recommendation, if you don't notice any performance issues, just leave the default settings. Otherwise, you may try increasing the event frequency or reducing the character search range for AI rulers via the corresponding game rules.
