[h2]Overview[/h2]

Do you find yourself spending a lot of time finding spouses for your courtiers, or deciding on characters to invite to your court, who could be better councillors, court position holders, knights, or commanders? While both [b]Find Spouse[/b] and [b]Invite to Court[/b] interactions are great since they enable the player to attract better talent and furthermore do it for free, they suffer from a few major drawbacks:
[list]
  [*] Choosing among numerous options and for many courtiers requires a lot of effort.
  [*] The AI never uses them, ending up with a worse talent pool as a result, while the player can get the best courtiers at their leisure, as they are usually not married and there is hardly any competition.
[/list]

I personally find the above aspects to be tedious, unrealistic, and underwhelming. Why should it take so much effort to find good spouses for courtiers? Why would courtiers depend so much on their liege for getting married? And why should players enjoy such overwhelming advantages over the AI to attract valuable courtiers?

This mod attempts to address these drawbacks by enabling courtiers to actively search for spouses by themselves (and in the future also suggest to be invited) and only ask their liege for approval, thereby reducing the effort for the player, improving the quality of AI talent pools, and also contributing to better roleplaying and immersion.

The main feature of this mod is the new [b]Courtier Requests to Marry[/b] event. It is triggered for playable (count or higher) rulers, every year for players and every 1 to 3 years (depending on rank) for the AI by default. These event frequencies can be changed via game rules.

When the event fires, first a random eligible [i]courtier[/i] is selected who will search for a spouse. To be eligible, a courtier must satisfy a number of conditions, such as being an available adult, not already married or betrothed, younger than 60 years and not having a serious health condition, not an heir or close family to their liege (since these are already married by the AI for alliances), and not "wrong gender in faith", e.g. a female in a faith with the male-dominated doctrine (the eligibility of such characters can be configured via a game rule).

After the courtier has been selected, a marriage [i]candidate[/i] is also selected among all eligible non-ruler characters in this and neighboring realms and located within a certain range of the original ruler's capital that can also be configured via game rules. The final candidate is the highest [i]quality[/i] candidate among all [i]eligible candidates[/i] whose matchmaker would accept the marriage proposal. To be eligible, a candidate must satisfy many of the same conditions that apply when selecting a courtier, and in addition they must be someone whom the courtier can actually marry according to their gender and faith. The candidates' quality is evaluated from the perspective of the courtier, based on various criteria such as opinion, attraction, fertility, health, age and age difference, dynasty prestige difference, faith hostility, cultural acceptance, genetic traits, and skills.

After a courtier and a candidate have been selected, the courtier's liege must approve or reject the marriage. Note that since the candidate has been selected based on their quality from the courtier's perspective, they are not automatically a good choice for their liege. However, often this is actually the case, since many of the criteria used to determine the quality would be relevant to the liege as well. So while courtiers would in most cases not make better choices than you as a player might make, they would usually make reasonable choices that are also of good roleplaying value.

AI rulers are in general more eager to approve outsiders rather than current courtiers, since this enables them to attract talent to their court. They also take the into account various other criteria such as their opinion of both the courtier and the candidate, family and other relations, the candidate quality, and are they better than other options for any councillor or court positions, knight, or commander, among others. Players can take these into account as well, since they are listed in the event description.

To make it more convenient for players to trigger the event for particular courtiers, this mod adds the new [b]Ask to Find Spouse[/b] interaction. Only courtiers who are eligible according to the criteria mentioned above can be targeted by this interaction.

Even if AI rulers get better talent pools, they are not always good at using them. In particular, they often stick to councillors or court position holders with worse skills or aptitude than available. For this reason, and also to remind players, this mod also introduces the new [b]Courtier Jostles for Position[/b] event. This event is triggered after a candidate has joined a court if they have been evaluated as better than other options for a councillor or court position. In it, the candidate requests to be appointed to that position, and their liege can accept or decline. The AI decision is based on their opinion of both the candidate and the [i]incumbent[/i], family and other relations, how much better than the incumbent is the candidate, is the incumbent councillor a powerful vassal, and the court position candidate score of the candidate.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]

The current version is compatible with CK3 1.11 and is also savegame compatible.

This mod does not modify any vanilla files and should be compatible with most other mods. Note that some total conversion mods remove parts of vanilla that may be referred to by this mod, so compatibility with such mods is not guaranteed. Also, this mod cannot properly evaluate candidates for councillor or court positions introduced by conversion mods without a compatch.

The [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3037969445]Love Marriage Family[/url] mod also features marriage requests by courtiers, but for different purposes and only limited to the player's realm. The two mods are compatible with each other and the frequency of their events can be configured via game rules. If you use LMF or other mods that change the marriage acceptance by AI, set the game rule [b]Marriage Acceptance by AI[/b] to [b]Original[/b].

This mod also supports changing its game rules mid-game with the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2826829936]Gamerule Gadget[/url] mod.

[h2]Localization[/h2]

This mod is currently available in English and Russian. For other languages, it uses the original English text as a placeholder.

[h2]Performance[/h2]

Since the additional events introduced by this mod fire on a regular basis for a few hundred AI rulers and involve sophisticated character searches, they may negatively affect the overall game performance. Therefore, this mod introduces game rules to enable players to find the best balance between a better AI and a smooth gameplay experience. With the default settings, this mod is about 10% slower than vanilla if measured on max speed in observer mode, a difference that is usually not noticeable during an actual gameplay.

As a recommendation, if you don't notice any performance issues, just leave the default settings. Otherwise, you may try increasing the event frequency or reducing the character search range for AI rulers via the corresponding game rules.
